With thousands of COVID-19 cases on the rise, we look back and see that it has already been more than a year and a half since the first COVID-19 case has been recorded [1]. After months and months of the raging pandemic, many begin to wonder: what will it take to end it? As scientists and researchers scramble to come up with a global solution, many begin to educate themselves on the topic. In our paper, done by weeks of research, analysis, simulations, and coding, we look and touch upon the progression of COVID-19. Beginning with basic research, we looked at the different types of vaccines that are being distributed, and found articles that mentioned the best way to end the pandemic worldwide. Along with basic research came simulating situations of the pandemic: this was done with none other than the programming language, Javascript, which was chosen for the fact that our simulation was going to be mostly web-based. Based on prior simulations, we came up with a model that was both accurate and visually intuitive. We then used the simulation to obtain results and graph data. From the graphs that we obtained and kept, we were able to discuss and talk about the results that came up from it, such as analyzing the spread of the virus through different levels of masked or vaccinated individuals. From the basic steps of learning how to code to learning how to make graphs to represent the pandemic, we are able to grasp our current situation as well as educate others and ourselves on the biggest global concern today.
